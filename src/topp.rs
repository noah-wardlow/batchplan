//! Time-optimal timing of a planned path (TOPP-RA, Pham & Pham 2018) under per-joint velocity and
//! acceleration limits, then smoothed so jerk stays bounded too.
//!
//! The path is a uniform cubic B-spline `P(s)` with `s` in spans. On a grid of stages along `s`,
//! the state is `x = ṡ²` and the control `u = s̈`, constant between stages, so
//! `x[i + 1] = x[i] + 2 Δ u[i]`. Joint velocity `P′ ṡ` and acceleration `P′ s̈ + P″ ṡ²` are linear in
//! `(u, x)`: velocity limits cap `x`, acceleration limits are two half-planes per joint. A backward
//! pass finds each stage's controllable interval of `x` (what the later stages can still brake
//! from); a forward pass then takes the largest `u` that stays in them. Each stage's interval is
//! exact: for fixed `x` the feasible `u` lie between the largest of some lines in `x` and the
//! smallest of others, so the feasible `x` are where every such pair is ordered.
//!
//! The resulting `s(t)` has steps in `s̈`, so unbounded jerk. The time map that replaces it is a
//! uniform cubic B-spline `σ(t)` whose control points are `s` at their Greville points, which
//! smooths it while keeping it monotone; the map is then stretched in time just enough that
//! velocity, acceleration and jerk, sampled densely, keep their limits.
